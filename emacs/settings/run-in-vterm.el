;;; package --- Summary
;;; A nice little function to launch a vterm running a command.

;;; Commentary:
;;; Hopefully useful for me to run e.g. compiles of a client and server at the same time


;;; Code:


;; From https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ft84xy/run_shell_command_in_new_vterm/

(defun run-in-vterm-kill (process event)
  "A process sentinel. Kills PROCESS's buffer if it is live."
  (let ((b (process-buffer process)))
    (and (buffer-live-p b)
         (kill-buffer b))))

(defun run-in-vterm (command)
  "Execute string COMMAND in a new vterm.

Interactively, prompt for COMMAND with the current buffer's file
name supplied. When called from Dired, supply the name of the
file at point.

Like `async-shell-command`, but run in a vterm for full terminal features.

The new vterm buffer is named in the form `*foo bar.baz*`, the
command and its arguments in earmuffs.

When the command terminates, the shell remains open, but when the
shell exits, the buffer is killed."
  (interactive
   (list
    (let* ((f (cond (buffer-file-name)
                    ((eq major-mode 'dired-mode)
                     (dired-get-filename nil t))))
           (filename (concat " " (shell-quote-argument (and f (file-relative-name f))))))
      (read-shell-command "Terminal command: "
                          (cons filename 0)
                          (cons 'shell-command-history 1)
                          (list filename)))))
